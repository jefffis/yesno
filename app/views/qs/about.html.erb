<p><span>yesno</span> is a simple app that allows users (without registering/logging in) to vote on yes or no questions. They can also create their own and share them socaily or with friends.</p>
<p class="beta">This is still in uber-beta, and is mostly a side-project; so if anything wonks out, that&rsquo;s why. I&rsquo;ll do my best to fix it of course, but have a wee bit o&rsquo; patience please <span>â˜º</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>To get started, follow these simple steps:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>from anywhere on the site, click <span>yes</span> in the logo to show only questions with a majority of <span>yes</span> answers <em>(give it a go now, we&rsquo;ll wait)</em></li>
	<li>conversly, clicking <span>no</span> will do the same for questions with a majority of <span>no</span> answers</li>
	<li>then, when you&rsquo;ve found a question that strikes your fancy, click the title</li>
	<li>from the question detail page, simply click or tap or <span>yes</span> or <span>no</span> to vote</li>
	<li>then, you&rsquo;ll see the results so far</li>
	<li>now, feel free to share this on Twitter or Facebook, or <span>yesno</span> give you two URLs (click <span class="icon-share-alt"></span> to view these as well as sharing links) you can share that users can auto-vote <span>yes</span> or <span>no</span> with by simply visiting that URL</li>
	<li>and voila, that&rsquo;s it</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Easy as pie, no?</h2>
<p>You can then <span class="icon-repeat"></span> to get a new question, or you can <span class="icon-search"></span> for another question as well. Also, clicking the <span class="icon-star"></span> will filter the questions by only those with more than 25 total votes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Or you can create your own question:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>click the <span class="icon-plus"></span> to get started</li>
	<li>add in a title <span>(required)</span>, a description (optional), and 2 images if you feel it will help the user decide</li>
	<li>lastly, hit publish and off you go</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Cookies, hmmmm?</h2>
<p>Yep, you got it. This site extensively uses cookies to track your responses and actions. I don&rsquo;t do <span>ANYTHING</span> with them of course, and I won&rsquo;t ever sell the data or anyting like that. So yes, you could delete the cookie and game the system, but what would be the fun in that?</p>
<p>Another reason for using cookies is so that you don&rsquo;t need to create another user account that you&rsquo;ll [probably] struggle to remember the password to, and it just makes the site easier to use and enjoy.</p>
